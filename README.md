# Godot GodotHub Class API

The main idea of GodotHub is to have a thin server that only handle the connection and broadcast the data to channel(lobby).

[GodotHub](https://github.com/Windastella/godothub) : GodotHub NodeJS Server

## Implementation

The class for the client is in scripts/godothub.gd . Copy and load it into your game through script.


```
extends Node

onready var godothub = preload('scripts/godothub.gd')
onready var conn = godothub.new()

func _ready():
	set_process(true)

  # Connect to message signal of godothub to callback
	conn.connect("message",self,"_on_receive")

func _process(dt):

  # Listening for packet
	conn.is_listening()

# Callback for receiving incoming packet
func _on_receive(data):
	print("Receive Data: ",data)

```
